# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: Thurs June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML + CSS + Responsive Bootstrap part of Front End development certification from FCC

**Thoughts**: I've done a lot of this before, but adhoc, so it was a good refresher. Also I learned about form element for the first time and keen to learn more how to store the data inputed. That's a big part of the reason why I'm doing this course, to try and implement basic backend coding to be able to store data in prototypes. I've never been good at sticking to commitment with these kinds of challenges - so I'm really hoping this time will be different!

**Time spent coding**: 3 hours

### Day 1: Fri June 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed jQuery course

**Thoughts**: Really interesting to learn how easy it is to manipulate html and css using jQuery and all kinds of interactive projects are popping in my mind to try! I'm at the beginning of the first front end development project which is build a tribute page, and I'm hoping to incorpoate some jQuery into it.

**Time spent coding**: 1 hour

### Day 2: Sun June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Designed and experimented for tribute page task

**Thoughts**: So I missed Sat! I think maybe going forward it will be hard to code on Saturdays, so might need to include that in the rules. Today I went to the Summer of Love exhibition at the De Young Museum in San Francisco, and was so inspired that I've decided to do my tribute page on the Summer of Love. I've realised I'm going to frame my 100DaysOfCode to be more of a 100daysofmake because I spent a lot of time designing and researching this tribute page today, and not that much time coding! I did however discover the new css blend mode property, as well as experimented with css patterns and radial gradients.

**Time spent coding**: 1 hour
