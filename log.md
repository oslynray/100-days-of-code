**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 0: Thurs June 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed HTML + CSS + Responsive Bootstrap part of Front End development certification from FCC

**Thoughts**: I've done a lot of this before, but adhoc, so it was a good refresher. Also I learned about form element for the first time and keen to learn more how to store the data inputed. That's a big part of the reason why I'm doing this course, to try and implement basic backend coding to be able to store data in prototypes. I've never been good at sticking to commitment with these kinds of challenges - so I'm really hoping this time will be different!

**Time spent coding**: 3 hours
